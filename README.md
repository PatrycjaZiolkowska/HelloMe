## AboutMe

Hi! 

My name is Patrycja Ziółkowska, and I have just finished postgraduate studies in Software Testing, currently I am testing for two companies.
 
I have really good testing knowledge (testing techniques and life cycle, I know creating rules for test cases and reports, i am familiar with tools: Jira for project management, Git for version control, SQL for database management, TestRail for test case management, Python for automation testing, and Linux for operating system management. Overall, I have a strong foundational knowledge in these areas

I am working as manual tester, but I want to develop my skills in programming languages and automation testing tools.

I have a bachelor's degree in English studies, and I am using English daily, so I can easily communicate and write.

Best regards!
