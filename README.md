## AboutMe

My name is Patrycja Ziółkowska, and I am a student at Postgraduate Studies in Software Testing, currently I am ready to join a QA team. 
 
I know the Software Development Life Cycle, I understand differences between Scrum and Kanban. 
I have knowledge of types of tests and software testing techniques. 

Additionally I made few courses, to develop new skills - Jira, SQL. At school we learnt Linux, so working with terminal isn't something new for me. I am familiar with tools like TestRail, Github, Gitlab.

I have a bachelor's degree in English studies, and I am using English daily, so I can easily communicate and write.

Best regards!
