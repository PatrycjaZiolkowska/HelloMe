## AboutMe

Hi! 

My name is Patrycja Ziółkowska, and I have just finished postgraduate studies in Software Testing, currently I am testing for two companies.
 
I have really good testing knowledge (testing techniques and life cycle, I know creating rules for test cases and reports, i am familiar with tools:GIT, SQL(I really like it), TestRailQA, Jira).

I am working as manual tester, but I am also interested in automation testing, I am constantly learning and developing myself.

I have a bachelor's degree in English studies, and I am using English daily, so I can easily communicate and write.

Best regards!
